# Collection of Object-Oriented Python Games, including TicTacToe, Black Jack, and Tamagotchi

This repository contains several games and exercises created as part of my progress through a Udemy course on Python programming, from beginner to advanced level. The projects in this repository include TicTacToe, Black Jack, and a Tamagotchi-style game, all implemented using object-oriented programming principles. In addition to the games, there are also several warm-up exercises included in the repository.

To explore the contents of the repository, you can review the project assignments and try out the games. Some of the projects were completed using workthrough notebooks provided by the Udemy course. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced programmer, this repository is a great resource for learning object-oriented programming in Python and creating fun games.
